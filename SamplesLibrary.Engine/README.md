# SamplesLibrary.Engine

This project contains the infrastructure and sample source code for the **SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET** samples.  This is a library project and not intended to be run on its own.  

Please see the main [SpreadsheetGearExplorerSamples repository's README](../README.md) for more information on running these samples in potentially the following ways (some of the below apps require Windows):

  - **Web Explorer Samples**
  - **WPF Explorer Samples**
  - **Windows Forms Explorer Samples**

> [!NOTE]
> Many of these **SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET** samples are also available as runnable samples on our own website at:

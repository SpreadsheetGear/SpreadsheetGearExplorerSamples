# SamplesLibrary.Windows

This project contains the infrastructure and sample source code for the **SpreadsheetGear for Windows** samples.  It also pulls in a reference to the `SamplesLibrary.Engine` project for **SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET** and other infrastructure code.  This is a library project and not intended to be run on its own.  

Please see the main [SpreadsheetGearExplorerSamples repository's README](../README.md) for more information on running these samples in the following ways:

  - **Web Explorer Samples**
  - **WPF Explorer Samples**
  - **Windows Forms Explorer Samples**

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the **SpreadsheetGear for Windows** product targets `net6.0-windows` and so is not support in non-Windows environments such as MacOS or Linux.

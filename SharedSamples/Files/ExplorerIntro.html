  </p>

  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><b>SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET</b> - the primary SpreadsheetGear library that provides a core set of APIs to read, write, manipulate and calculate workbooks, build charts, format worksheets and cells, and more.</li>
    <li class="normal"><b>SpreadsheetGear for Windows</b> - builds on the <b>SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET</b> to add powerful Excel-compatible viewing, editing, formatting, calculating, filtering, sorting, charting, printing and more to your Windows Forms and WPF applications with the easy-to-use WorkbookView and FormulaBar controls.</li>

<h2>SpreadsheetGearExplorer Visual Studio Solution Description</h2>
<div class="indent mb-4">
  <p>The three executable Visual Studio projects (<b>WindowsFormsExplorer</b>, <b>WPFExplorer</b> and <b>WebExplorer</b>) utilize a set of samples that are defined primarily in the <b>SharedSamples</b> Visual Studio library project.  This <b>SharedSamples</b> library utilizes two primary sample types, derived from the following base class / interface:

  <ul>
    <li class="normal"><b><code>SharedEngineSample</code></b> - samples deriving from this class demonstrate features that depend only on API available from the <b>SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET</b> product, thereby showing how such routines can be solely executed in-memory / programmatically (i.e, no UI needs to be involved in the <i>execution</i> of these samples.  This is demonstrated most clearly when running the <b>Web Explorer</b> to execute these samples in the context of an ASP.NET Core Web App.  For the <b>Windows Forms Explorer</b> and <b>WPF Explorer</b>, the workbook in which a given sample is executed is displayed on a WorkbookView UI control to more easily observe the results..</li>
    <li class="normal"><b><code>ISharedWindowsSample</code></b> - samples derived from this interface will demonstrate features that more directly involves a UI of some sort, such as the <code>WorkbookView</code> control.  Much of the source code for these samples is still defined within the <b>SharedSamples</b> Visual Studio project, but supporting UI framework-specifc code is also required in the individual <b>WindowsFormsExplorer</b> and <b>WPFExplorer</b> projects.  In a few cases, sample source code is not shared at all and instead entirely defined from within the <b>WindowsFormsExplorer</b> and <b>WPFExplorer</b> projects because they depend on specific features only available to their particular UI framework (such as Control Templates in XAML to stylize a WPF WorkbookView).</li>
  </ul>
